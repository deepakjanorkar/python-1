Python can search for file names in a specified path of the OS.
This can be done using the module os with the walk() functions. 
This will take a specific path as input and generate a 3-tuple involving dirpath, dirnames, and filenames.

Example:-
import os

def find_files(filename, search_path):
   result = []

# Wlaking top-down from the root
   for root, dir, files in os.walk(search_path):
      if filename in files:
         result.append(os.path.join(root, filename))
   return result

print(find_files("smpl.htm","D:"))
